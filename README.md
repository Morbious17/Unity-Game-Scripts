# Unity Game Scripts
After a year of classes at DigiPen, I rewrote all my code from scratch. My new code is shorter and more efficient, and I have been able to accomplish much more in this version of my prototype. I now have a working inventory, weapon system with animated melee weapons/fireams, collectibles system, settings system, and map system that contains an icon on the map that rotates and moves with the player and reveals the map.
