# Unity Game Scripts
These scripts were created during the summer as part of a 3D game prototype. Due to time constraints, 
the development of these scripts has been put on hold.
I learned C# on my own before attempting to write code in UnityScript. If you see poor coding
conventions in every file, this is why. I'm currently studying at DigiPen Institute of Technology,
so this code will eventually be edited or replaced with professional, efficient code.
